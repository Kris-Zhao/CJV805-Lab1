Reflection: 
There are three classes. 

The first OracleInfo class stores my oracle database information that can be used in other classes.

The ShowEmployeeInfoByID class is to connect to my oracle database via OCI driver. At the same time, using callablestatements and 
predefined PL/SQL procedure "getEMPLOYEEById.sql" to gain the employee's full name, email and salary by given employee ID.

The ShowTotalEmployeeByDeptID class can show respectively using Oracle Thin and OCI database driver to implement the connection. Similarly, using
callablestatements and predefined PL/SQL procedure "total_emp_by_dept_id" to obtain the number of employees in a department by department id.
